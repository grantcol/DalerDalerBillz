## General Repo Etiquette
1. Create your own branch and work from there. Run all unit tests in this branch. 
2. Don't push to the master branch unless you've notified at least one other person. 
3. Push relevant commit messages. Or something semi useful.
4. Use issues as a means of communicating long-standing issues you'd like to share with the team. This way we can all chip in.

## Tools/APIs
To test the project locally I would suggest using [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/en/) which is free and pretty common for testing PHP/MySQL apps. It's pretty straight forward to set up and run. 
Along with [The Echonest](http://developer.echonest.com/) and [LyricFind](http://developer.echonest.com/sandbox/lyricfind.html) APIs, we will also be using the [Spotify Web Api](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api) for the artist searching, images and song names since they have a neat [/search endpoint](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/search-item/) which makes things much easier for autocomplete and general search queries. Check the linked docs if you have any questions about querying the provided endpoints.
