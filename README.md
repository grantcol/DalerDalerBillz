## General Repo Etiquette
1. Create your own branch and work from there. Run all unit tests in this branch. 
2. Don't push to the master branch unless you've notified at least one other person. 
3. Push relevant commit messages. Or something semi useful.
4. Use issues as a means of communicating long-standing issues you'd like to share with the team. This way we can all chip in.
